    "The post-pandemic era presents unprecedented challenges for individuals managing their mental health. Studies indicate that music has played a significant role in improving both physical and mental well-being (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8566759/). I am eager to explore the depth of music's influence on mental health and extract valuable insights from this study.\n",

    "\n",
    "As per the dataset collector and owner, the survey encompassed the following parameters:\n",
    "**Block 1: Music genres**\n",
    "Respondents selected Never, Rarely, Sometimes, or Very frequently to indicate the frequency of their listening to 16 music genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Block 2: Mental health**\n",
    "Respondents rated Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 representing the highest frequency and severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Scope & Procedures\n",
    "This analysis is based on data collected from 736 respondents across the US. The survey, conducted from Aug. 27 to Nov. 9, 2022, included participants of any age or location. The questionnaire comprised a mix of open-ended and drop-down questions, designed to elicit relatively concise responses and encourage participation."
